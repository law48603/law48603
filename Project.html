	<h2>Family Background</h2>
		<p>If you know anything about me it is that I am a big family girl. Family over everything, always. text text text text text text text text</p>
	<h2>Education</h2>
		<p>I am currently a student at the University of Georgia... GO DAWGS! Since I was a kid and even last year 
		as a freshman, I told myself I wanted to study medicine and go to med or nursing school. Turns out life 
		doesn't always go the way you thought it would, and after eight changes to my major (yes that's right, I have 
		changed my major <i>EIGHT</i> times), I finally decided being a nurse or doctor was not for me. At this point 
		in my college ~journey~ as a young freshman, I had have several life crisises questioning what I wanted to do 
		with my life, and found myself exploring majors ranging from exercise and sports science to public relations. 
		Still, I had found nothing that I genuinely enjoyed or could see myself pursing a career in, so during drop/add 
		week at the beginning of this past semester (beginning of my sophomore year), I thought I would give the 
		business side of things a try and changed my major once again. So here I am today, a current Marketing 
		(intended) student still figuring it out so some extent, but at least I can now say that this is something that 
		I do enjoy and can actually see my future self doing with my life.</p>
