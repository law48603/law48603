	<h1>WELCOME</h1>
		<p>Here you will find some info about my life and who I am! Enjoy :)</p>
	<h2>Family Background</h2>
		<p>I'm always so entertained when people try to guess my ethnicity because they can never figure it out. 
		Hawaiian or Native American are among the most common of the backgrounds I get, but all (sadly)
		incorrect (...being those ethnicities would be a dream). I am... drumroll please... half-Korean 
		half-White. My mom is full Korean, born there and and everything, while my dad is a white man from California. 
		No, I do not know how to speak Korean, nor understand it. In fact, my own Korean mom cannot even speak the 
		language, although she can understand it somewhat. Some say it's sad we don't take advantage of our Korean 
		background, but I'll give it to her, she moved to America when she was 4 years old, so you could say we are 
		a pretty Americanized family. I do embrace the Korean in me though, and find it as an important aspect of my 
		life that I love.</p>
		<p>Another aspect of my life that I love talking about are my siblings and having (what I consider) a pretty 
		big family. With three girls and a stepbrother, there is always <i>something</i> going on in the house. In age 
		order, there's my older sister who is a senior at UGA, me -- a sophomore at UGA, my stepbrother who is a senior 
		in highschool, and my younger sister who is a junior in high school. My siblings are awesome and way cooler 
		than I'll ever be.</p>
