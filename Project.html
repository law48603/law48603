	<h2>Family Background</h2>
		<p>I'm always so entertained when people try to guess my ethnicity because they can never figure it out. 
		Hawaiian or Native American are among the most common of the backgrounds I get, but all (sadly)
		incorrect (...being those ethnicities would be a dream). I am... drumroll please... half-Korean 
		half-White. My mom is full Korean, born there and and everything, while my dad is a white man from California. 
		No, I do not know how to speak Korean, nor understand it. In fact, my own Korean mom cannot even speak the 
		language, although she can understand it somewhat. Some say it's sad we don't take advantage of our Korean 
		background, but I'll give it to her, she moved to America when she was 4 years old, so you could say we are 
		a pretty Americanized family. 
		<p>Having two sisters and a stepbrother, being with my family is the best. 
		I have an older sister who is a senior at UGA, a younger brother who is a 
		senior in high school, and a younger sister who is a junior in high school. 
		We are all SO close -- they are basically my best friends.</p>
	<h2>High School Life</h2>
		<p></p>
	<h2>College Life</h2>
		<p>I am currently a second year student at the University of Georgia and will be 
		applying to the Terry College of Business next semester. It was quite the journey 
		to get here though, considering I changed my major 7 times before choosing marketing!</p>
	
	<p>I live in the great Outback of Australia.

	<p>I bet you're wondering how a cute little furball like me found
	his way onto the Internet. Well, <i>radioactive mutations</i>
	due to French nuclear testing in the Pacific have made me
	<i>four times smarter</i> than you pea-brained primates! Way 
	cool, huh?</p>
	<p>Well, I gotta go. With my new super-intelligence, I'm working
	on a way to <b>rid the planet of you pesky humans forever!</b>
	Hahahahaha!!</p>
	<p>See you later (chuckle),</p>
