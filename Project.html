	<h2>Family</h2>
		<p>Having two sisters and a stepbrother, being with my family is the best. 
		I have an older sister who is a senior at UGA, and a younger sister who is 
		a junior in high school.</p>
	<h2>High School Life</h2>
		<p></p>
	<h2>College Life</h2>
		<p>I am currently a second year student at the University of Georgia and will be 
		applying to the Terry College of Business next semester. It was quite the journey 
		to get here though, considering I changed my major 7 times before choosing marketing!</p>
	
	<p>I live in the great Outback of Australia.

	<p>I bet you're wondering how a cute little furball like me found
	his way onto the Internet. Well, <i>radioactive mutations</i>
	due to French nuclear testing in the Pacific have made me
	<i>four times smarter</i> than you pea-brained primates! Way 
	cool, huh?</p>
	<p>Well, I gotta go. With my new super-intelligence, I'm working
	on a way to <b>rid the planet of you pesky humans forever!</b>
	Hahahahaha!!</p>
	<p>See you later (chuckle),</p>
